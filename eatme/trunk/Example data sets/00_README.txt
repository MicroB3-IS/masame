#
# Grouping data
#
##############################

=====================
exampleGroups.csv
=====================
A simple CSV (derived from the "Shrub" variable from the mite.env data set)
which contains a column of row names and a column of groups coded as factors.
Numerically coded groups are also acceptable.



##############################
#
# Stratification data
#
##############################

NB: Any factor (whether numerically coded or not) can be used as a 
stratification variable.

##############################

=====================
mite_weights.csv
===================== 
A simple CSV which contains a column of row names and a column of weights
derived from the mite data set (mite). These weights are equivalent to each
row marginal sum divided by the total sum of the mite data set.
